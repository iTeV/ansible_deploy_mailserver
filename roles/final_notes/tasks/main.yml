          - "Your mailserver is almost ready to go! There are just a few things that ansible can't do. One of these things is creating a subdomain called 'mail._domainkey' in the DNS control panel. Please create a TXT record for the 'mail._domainkey' subdomain with the following contents: redacted. After you've done this, create yet another subdomain called {{ mail_sub_domain }}. On top of that create a MX record for this subdomain the the following contents: '10 {{ mail_sub_domain }}.{{ mail_domain }}'. Another thing you have to be sure of is to check if the mailserver can be reached from outside your internal network, AKA the internet. That means that if you're on a NAT network, you need to forward the following ports: 25(TCP), 465(TCP), 587(TCP) & 993(TCP). If you're using a VPS from a VPS provider, make sure to create firewall rules to allow the previously mentioned ports."
